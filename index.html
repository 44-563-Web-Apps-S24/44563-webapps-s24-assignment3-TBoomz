        <h3>HuHot Mongolian Grill</h3>
        <p>
            I like HuHot as it's an all-you-can-eat buffet. 
            It's also one where not only do you picked the food/ingredients but also the 
            sauce for a stir fry you watch cooked in front of you on an <b>open grill</b>. 
            The food you can make is not only delicious but <b>unique to each time you go</b>.
