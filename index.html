        <h3>HuHot Mongolian Grill</h3>
        <p>HuHot is my favorite restaurant because of the dishes you can create. Rather than a typical menu with pre-decided dishes, HuHot is a <b>buffet-style</b> restaurant. The other cool thing is that you watch the food be <b>cooked in front of you</b> on an <b>open grill</b>.</p>
