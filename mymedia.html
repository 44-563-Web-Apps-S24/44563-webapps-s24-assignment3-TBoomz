            At present, some of my favorite books include the Percy Jackson series as it has a lot to do with Ancient Mythology. 
            It covers almost every region's mythology with some series or another, from Greek/Roman to Egyptian, to even Norse, 
            but with a lighter, more kid-friendly story and easier accessbility to all. 
            It's got representation of all kinds as well, and the author is well liked within his community.

            My favorite movie series is <i>How To Train Your Dragon</i>. It's about a viking boy that befriends and rides a 
            dragon rather than killing it. Despite the adversity he faces and the doubts of his community, his knowledge becomes 
            their greatest strength.
